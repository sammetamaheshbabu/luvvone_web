        <h3>1. Agreement to These Terms</h3>
        <p>
          These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your use of the Luvvone
          mobile application and related services (“Service”). By accessing or
          using the Service, you agree to these Terms.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Who Can Use Luvvone</h3>
        <p>
          You must be legally able to form a binding contract in your
          jurisdiction to use Luvvone. Luvvone is not directed to children
          under 13 (or the minimum age required where you live).
        </p>

        <h3>3. Account, Verification, and One-to-One Design</h3>
        <p>
          Luvvone is designed for one-to-one pairing. You agree to provide
          accurate information for account verification (such as phone-based
          sign-in) and to maintain the security of your device and account.
        </p>
        <ul style="
              list-style-type: disc;
              margin-left: 20px;
              color: var(--text-secondary);
              margin-bottom: 20px;
            ">
          <li>No impersonation or deceptive identity.</li>
          <li>No automated account creation or abuse of verification.</li>
          <li>
            You are responsible for activities that occur under your account.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4. Privacy and End-to-End Encryption</h3>
        <p>
          Luvvone is designed so that message content is encrypted on your
          device before transmission. We do not intend to store plaintext
          message content on our servers.
        </p>
        <p>
          You understand that (a) you and your partner control what you share,
          (b) if you lose your device or uninstall the app, you may lose
          locally stored message history, and (c) metadata (like delivery
          timestamps and sender/recipient identifiers) may still exist for
          delivery and security purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our collection and use of information is described in our
          <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.
        </p>

        <h3>5. Acceptable Use</h3>
        <p>You agree not to misuse the Service. This includes:</p>
        <ul style="
              list-style-type: disc;
              margin-left: 20px;
              color: var(--text-secondary);
              margin-bottom: 20px;
            ">
          <li>Illegal activity or facilitation of illegal activity.</li>
          <li>Harassment, threats, exploitation, or abuse.</li>
          <li>
            Attempting to bypass security controls, scrape the Service, or
            probe for vulnerabilities.
          </li>
          <li>
            Uploading malware, or content that infringes intellectual
            property.
          </li>
          <li>
            Using the Service to distribute prohibited content, including
            content involving sexual exploitation of minors.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>6. User Content</h3>
        <p>
          You are responsible for the content you send or upload through the
          Service (“User Content”). You represent that you have the rights
          necessary to share your User Content.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may remove or restrict content or accounts if we believe they
          violate these Terms, pose safety risks, or are required to comply
          with law.
        </p>

        <h3>7. Third-Party Services</h3>
        <p>
          The Service may rely on third-party infrastructure providers (for
          example, cloud authentication, databases, push notifications, and
          storage). Your use of the Service may therefore be subject to
          additional terms or policies from those providers.
        </p>

        <h4 style="margin-top: 18px">7.1 App Store / Google Play terms</h4>
        <p>
          If you download Luvvone through the Apple App Store or Google Play,
          your use of those platforms is also governed by their separate terms
          and policies. Apple and Google are not parties to these Terms and
          are not responsible for providing the Service.
        </p>

        <h4 style="margin-top: 18px">
          7.2 Purchases, subscriptions, and refunds
        </h4>
        <p>
          If we offer paid features (including one-time purchases or
          subscriptions), billing is typically processed by the platform you
          used to obtain the app (for example, Apple or Google). Any refund
          requests are handled according to the platform’s refund policies and
          applicable law. If a subscription is offered and you purchase it,
          you can usually manage or cancel it in your device’s account
          settings for the relevant platform.
        </p>

        <h3>8. Suspension and Termination</h3>
        <p>
          We may suspend or terminate access to the Service if we believe you
          have violated these Terms, if required by law, or to protect the
          security of users and the Service.
        </p>

        <h3>9. Intellectual Property</h3>
        <p>
          The Service, including software, design, branding, and associated
          materials, is owned by Luvvone or its licensors and is protected by
          intellectual property laws. You receive a limited, non-exclusive,
          non-transferable license to use the Service for personal,
          non-commercial use in accordance with these Terms.
        </p>

        <h3>10. Disclaimers</h3>
        <p>
          The Service is provided “as is” and “as available”. To the maximum
          extent permitted by law, we disclaim warranties of merchantability,
          fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.
        </p>

        <h3>11. Limitation of Liability</h3>
        <p>
          To the maximum extent permitted by law, Luvvone will not be liable
          for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive
          damages, or any loss of data, profits, or revenues, even if we have
          been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        </p>

        <h3>12. Changes to the Service or Terms</h3>
        <p>
          We may update the Service and these Terms from time to time. When we
          do, we will update the effective date above.
        </p>

        <h3>13. Governing Law and Disputes</h3>
        <p>
          These Terms are governed by the laws of the jurisdiction where
          Luvvone is established, without regard to conflict-of-law rules.
          Disputes will be resolved in the courts with appropriate
          jurisdiction, unless applicable law requires otherwise.
        </p>
